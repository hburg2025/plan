Before anything else, please:

<OL>
	<LI> <B>Be smart about personal information!</B>  You will notice <U>we don't ask for any information</U> on this site.  You <I>should</I> be suspecious of anyone asking for detailed personal information, even if they seem like they want to help or belong to a community organization.  Also, try to consider the risk that people you share sensitive personal information with could be targeted by an ICE raid themselves:  is it low risk, or higher risk? <P>
 <UL>
	 <LI> Don't leave sensitive information in a place where ICE could find it during a raid.  [TODO, backpack story of A.]<P>

	 <LI> As part of your plan, you may decide to use <I>legal documents</I> that will contain some personal information and must be signed and stamped by a <B>notary public</B>. Notarization helps to prove that the document was really signed by the person whose name is on it and that that person signed it willingly.  In Virginia, a notary may not legally charge more than $10 to notarize a document and most banks will notarize a document for free. <P>
		 <I>However, notaries may not give legal advice in the United States unless they are also licensed lawyers</I>. <B>Never ask or pay a notary for legal advice</B>. <U>They are not qualified to provide it, and relying on legal advice from a notary can be dangerous</U>.  You should talk with an attorney instead.  <P>
 </UL><P>

 <LI> <B>Reach out for more help, as needed.</B>  If you own real estate or business property, or have any criminal background, <I>you should definitely talk to attorney</I> for legal help.  If you have children or adults who depend on you, <I>you may want to talk to an attorney</I> about legal options in case you are detained or deported.  [TODO:  other "scope" cases?]<P> 

Some local community groups who work with undocumented immigrants and attorneys who can represent them include: <P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="https://www.justice4all.org/">Legal Aid Justice Center</A> (Charlottesville, VA),  Phone: (434) 977-0553 | International: 1-800-269-4717 (In Mexico, dial 001 first)
<LI> <A HREF="https://www.cospu.org/">COSPU</A> (Harrisonburg, VA)
<LI> <A HREF="https://newbridgesirc.org/">New Bridges</A> (Harrisonburg, VA)
<LI> [TODO]  CWS, Skyline?  others?
<LI> [TODO]  emerging pro bono lawyer groups.
</UL><P>

<LI>  <B>Don't panic!  Take action, but don't rush.</B>  You probably won't finish all of the planning or conversations in one sitting.  Do what you can with your family and your community to <I>plan a little bit each day or two</I> over a few weeks, rather than getting overwhelmed or giving up.
