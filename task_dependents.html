The kind of things you might <B>ask for someone to help with</B> are:
<UL>
<LI> You need someone to take care of your child.  <B>Choose a "trusted helper"</B> and <U>share the following information with them</U> (for each child):
  <UL>
	  <LI>Full name, and date of birth
	  <LI>Medical conditions, allergies, prescriptions for medicine, pharmacy information, doctor information, insurance information
	  <LI>School, extracurricular activities
	  <LI>Babysitter contact information
	  <LI>Favorite toy, favorite food, other notes.
  </UL>
<LI> You need someone to take care of an adult dependent.  <B>Choose a "trusted helper"</B> and <U>share the following information with them</U> (for each dependent):
  <UL>
	  <LI>Full name, and date of birth
	  <LI>Medical conditions, allergies, prescriptions for medicine, pharmacy information, doctor information, insurance information
  </UL>
<LI> You need someone to take care of a pet.  <B>Choose a "trusted helper"</B> and <U>share the following information with them</U>:

	[TODO, statement: we worry about cps?] <BR>

	You can start a <I>legal process</I> called "guardianship" in case you are detained for a <B>longer time</B>.  This gives your "trusted helper" <U>more power</U> to make decisions for your dependent.  Generally, you sign a form in front of a notary to start the "guardianship" process.  Talk to [TODO] to discuss how to do this, and don't ever pay more than $10 for the notary service!  We recommend assigning "trusted helpers" who live in Virginia.  You may have to sign different "guardianship" forms for other states.<P>
