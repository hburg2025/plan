<H2><B>Help for dependents</B></H2><P>

<div class="boxed">
If you were detained by ICE for a <I>short time</I> or for a <I>longer time</I>, who would <B>take care of people that depend on you</B>, like your children? 
</div>

[TODO, share narratives; include an intro video; make this more engaging...]<P>

<HR>
First, <B>think about your own risks</B>.
<UL>
<LI> Sometimes an individual placed in custody may be detained for <I>a few days</I> to <I>several months</I> but is ultimately released with the ability to fight their case. <P>
<LI> Individuals with a criminal record, previous deportation, or those falling within ICE’s removal priorities, may face <I>deportation</I>. 
</UL>
What would your dependents need in these situations?<P>

<HR>
Next, <B>choose a "trusted helper"</B> that you or your dependents can call for help, in case of an ICE raid. <U>Share the following information with them</U> <I>as soon as you can</I>, so that they will already have all the information if an ICE raid happens.  (During a raid, it may be impossible to talk to your trusted helper or to share important information with them.)
<P>

The information you should share with the trusted helper are:
<UL>
<LI> For each of your <U>children</U> or <U>adult dependents</U>:
  <UL>
	  <LI><I>Identification</I>:  Full name, date of birth, social security or A-numbers <!-- [TODO:  include ssn/a numbers?  this is practice in Austin.] -->
	<LI><I>Medical information</I>:  list of conditions and allergies, prescriptions for medicine, pharmacy information, doctor information, insurance information
		<LI><I>Places this person spends time</I> (in case the trusted helper needs to find them):  school location, extracurricular activities, work locations
	  <!-- <LI>Babysitter contact information
	  <LI>Favorite toy, favorite food, other notes.-->
  </UL><P>
<LI> For each pet:
  <UL>
	  <LI>[TODO]
  </UL><P>
</UL>

<div class="boxed">
You can start a <I>legal process</I> called <span class="term">guardianship</span> in case you are detained.  This gives your "trusted helper" <U>more power</U> to make decisions for your dependent.  [TODO:  list what these are, typically.]
<UL>
	<LI>Usually, you sign a form in front of a notary to start the "guardianship" process.  Talk to [TODO] to do this.  A notary needs to witness you signing the form.  In Virginia, it is illegal to charge more than $10 for this service, so do not pay more!  <P>
		<LI>Guardianship using the form lasts for a limited time.  Before it expires, you will need to have an attorney work with a court to make the guardianship permanent.<P>
<LI> We recommend assigning guardians who live in Virginia.  Other states may have a similar process, but some details can be different and you may have to sign different guardianship forms.  Discuss with an attorney if this is something you need.
</UL>
</div><P>

<HR>
Finally, <U>share information with your dependents</U> so they know how to contact the trusted helper:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Make a wallet card</B> <I>for each dependent</I> with the name of the trusted helper and their phone number or address.  You can also add extra phone numbers of people close to the trusted helper, so it is faster to get in contact.<P>
<LI> <B>Make a meeting place</B> that everyone knows about, in case someone sees an ICE raid at their home.
</UL><P>
