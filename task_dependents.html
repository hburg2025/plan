<H2><B>Help for dependents</B></H2><P>

<div class="boxed">
If you were detained by ICE, who would <B>take care of your children and people that depend on you</B>, in an <I>emergency</I> or for a <I>longer time</I>?
</div>

[TODO, share narratives; include an intro video; make this more engaging...]<P>

<HR>
First, <B>think about your own risks</B>.
<UL>
<LI> Sometimes an individual placed in custody may be detained for <I>a few days</I> to <I>several months</I> but is ultimately released with the ability to fight their case. <P>
<LI> Individuals with a criminal record, previous deportation, or those falling within ICE’s removal priorities, may face <I>deportation</I>. 
</UL>
What would your dependents need in these situations?  Who would best care for your dependents in these situations?<P>

<HR>
Next, <B>choose one or more "trusted helpers"</B> that you or your dependents can call for help, in case of an ICE raid. <U>Share the following information with them</U> <I>as soon as you can</I>, so that they will already have all the information if an ICE raid happens.  (During a raid, it may be impossible to talk to your trusted helper or to share important information with them.)
<P>

The information you should share with the trusted helper are:
<UL>
<LI> For each of your <U>children</U> or <U>adult dependents</U>:
  <UL>
	  <LI><I>Identification</I>:  Full name, date of birth, social security or A-numbers <!-- [TODO:  include ssn/a numbers?  this is practice in Austin.] -->
	<LI><I>Medical information</I>:  list of conditions and allergies, prescriptions for medicine, pharmacy information, doctor information, insurance information
	<LI><I>Places this person spends time</I> (in case the trusted helper needs to find them):  school location, extracurricular activities, work locations
	  <!-- <LI>Babysitter contact information
	  <LI>Favorite toy, favorite food, other notes.-->
  </UL><P>
<LI> For each pet:
  <UL>
	  <LI>[TODO]
  </UL><P>
</UL>

<div class="boxed">
	You can start a <I>legal process</I> called <span class="term">guardianship</span> in case you are detained.  This gives your "trusted helper" <U>more power</U> to make decisions for your dependent.  <B>Most importantly, guardianship allows your "trusted helper" to work directly with <I>schools</I> and <I>doctors</I> to make decisions for your dependent.</B>  <I>If you are detained for more than a day or two, these powers may become necessary for your "trusted helper" to do the best job caring for your dependents.</I><P>
	<!-- [TODO:  list what these are, typically.] Enroll the child in school Make educational, medical, and other decisions Travel with the child domestically or internationally Receive and apply for public benefits for the child  -->
	Here's how it works:
<UL>
	<LI><B>You must set up guardianship in advance!</B>  This isn't something that your "trusted helper" or a child (under the age of 18) can do on their own after you are detained.  (This rule protects your legal rights as a parent.)<P>

	<LI>Usually, <B>you sign a form in front of a notary</B> to start the guardianship process.  Talk to [TODO] to do this.  A notary needs to witness you signing the form.  In Virginia, it is illegal to charge more than $10 for this service, so do not pay more!  <P>

		<LI>The powers of guardianship using the form <U>start when you are detained</U> and then <U>last for a limited time</U>.  Before it expires, <B>your "trusted helper" will need to have an attorney work with a court</B> to make the guardianship permanent.<P>

<LI> We recommend assigning guardians who live in Virginia.  Other states may have a similar process, but some details can be different and you may have to sign different guardianship forms.  Discuss with an attorney if this is something you need.
</UL>
</div><P>

<HR>
Finally, <U>share information with your dependents</U> so they know how to contact the trusted helpers:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Make a wallet card</B> <I>for each dependent</I> with the name of the trusted helper and their phone number or address.  You can also add extra phone numbers of people close to the trusted helper, so it is faster to get in contact.<P>
<LI> <B>Make a meeting place</B> that everyone knows about, in case someone sees an ICE raid at their home.
</UL><P>
