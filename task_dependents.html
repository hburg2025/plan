<div class="boxed">
	You can start a <I>legal process</I> called <span class="term">guardianship</span> in case you are detained.  This gives your "trusted helper" <U>more power</U> to make decisions for your dependent.  Generally, you sign a form in front of a notary to start the "guardianship" process.  Talk to [TODO] to discuss how to do this, and don't ever pay more than $10 for the notary service!  We recommend assigning "trusted helpers" who live in Virginia.  You may have to sign different "guardianship" forms for other states.</div><P>
