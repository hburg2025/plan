<H2><B>Parts of the plan</B></H2><P>

There are <U>three main areas</U> you will want to think about, as you plan:

<div class="boxed">
<OL>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE, who would <I>immediately</I> be able to <B>go to work from the outside</B> in order to help free you, submit legal paperwork for you, or post bond money?<P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE, who would <B>take care of your children and people that depend on you</B>, in an <I>emergency</I> or for a <I>longer time</I>?<P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE for a <I>longer time</I>, who would be able to <B>access your money, your car, or your personal property</B>?<P>
</OL>
</div>

These are big questions!  To talk about them, <U>we use these names</U>:
<UL>
<LI>We call people who depend on you, like children, <span class="term">your dependents</span>.  These could also be adults, such as aging parents.  Some people also make plans for their pets.<P>
	<LI>We call the things you own <span class="term">your assets</span>.  These are things like your car, bank account, and personal property.  We call things you pay for each month <span class="term">your accounts</span>.  These are things like your rent payment, car lease payment, cell phone payment, utility payment, and storage unit payment.<P>
	<LI>We call a person who will help with one of the tasks, while you are detained, a <span class="term">trusted helper</span>.  
</UL>
