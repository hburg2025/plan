<font size="+1">

There are <U>three main areas</U> you will want to think about, as you plan:

</font>
<font size="+2">
<OL>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE, who would <B>immediately</B> be able to <I>go to work from the outside</I> in order to help free you, submit legal paperwork for you, or post bond money?<P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE for a <B>short time</B> or for a <B>longer time</B>, who would <I>take care of people that depend on you</I>, like your children?  <P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE for a <B>longer time</B>, who would be able to access your money, your car, or your personal property?<P>
</OL>

</font>
<font size="+1">
To talk more about these, we need names:
</font>
<font size="+2">
<UL>
	<LI>We call people who depend on you, like children, "your dependents."  These could also be adults, such as aging parents.  Some people also make plans for their pets.<P>
		<LI>We call a person who will help with one of these tasks, while you are detained, a "trusted helper."  <B>It is very important that you only assign someone you trust</B> to do these tasks, because <U>they will need to have detailed access to your <B>personal information</B> in order to help you</U>.  Usually, a "trusted helper" will be another family member or close friend.  Do not assign a "trusted helper" that you don't already know well!<P>
	<LI>We call the things you own "your assets."  These are things like your car, bank account, and personal property.
</UL>
</font>
<font size="+1">

You don't need to have only one "trusted helper."  You should consider asking different people to be "trusted helpers" for different parts of your plan.  <P>

Your "trusted helper" does not need to be a US citizen or permanent resident, but try to assign people that have a strong immegration status (so that you do not need to change your plan if ICE moves against them).  <P>
