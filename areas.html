<H2><B>Parts of the plan</B></H2><P>

There are <U>three main areas</U> you will want to think about, as you plan:

<div class="boxed">
<OL>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE, who would <I>immediately</I> be able to <B>go to work from the outside</B> in order to help free you, submit legal paperwork for you, or post bond money?<P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE for a <I>short time</I> or for a <I>longer time</I>, who would <B>take care of people that depend on you</B>, like your children?  <P>
<LI> If you were detained by ICE for a <I>longer time</I>, who would be able to <B>access your money, your car, or your personal property</B>?<P>
</OL>
</div>

These are big questions!  To talk about them, <U>we use these names</U>:
<UL>
<LI>We call people who depend on you, like children, <span class="term">your dependents</span>.  These could also be adults, such as aging parents.  Some people also make plans for their pets.<P>
	<LI>We call the things you own <span class="term">your assets</span>.  These are things like your car, bank account, and personal property.  We call things you pay for each month <span class="term">your accounts</span>.  These are things like your rent payment, car lease payment, cell phone payment, utility payment, and storage unit payment.<P>
	<LI>We call a person who will help with one of the tasks, while you are detained, a <span class="term">trusted helper</span>.  
</UL>
<!--
<div class="boxed"><B>It is very important that you only assign someone you trust</B> to do these tasks, because <U>they will need to have detailed access to your <B>personal information</B> in order to help you</U>.  <P>Your plan goes into effect if you are detained by ICE, and then your <span class="term">trusted helper</span> takes over things that you would usually do while you are detained. </div> <P>

Here are a few more suggestions about <span class="term">trusted helpers</span>:
<UL>
	<LI>Usually, a "trusted helper" will be another family member or close friend.  Do not assign a "trusted helper" that you don't already know well!<P>

	<LI>Your "trusted helper" does not need to be a US citizen or permanent resident, but try to assign people that have a strong immegration status (so that you do not need to change your plan if ICE moves against them).  <P>

	<LI>You don't need to have only one "trusted helper."  You <I>can</I> ask <I>different</I> people to be "trusted helpers" for different parts of your plan.  <P>
</UL>
