<H2><B>Help with your assets and accounts</B></H2><P>

<div class="boxed">
If you were detained by ICE for a <I>longer time</I>, who would be able to <B>access your money, your car, or your personal property</B>?
</div>

[TODO, share narratives; include an intro video; make this more engaging... expand content.]<P>

First, <B>think about how your accounts and assets are used</B> in your household right now. <P> 

How could they be used by your "trusted helper" to take care of your dependents or to help you, in case you are detained by ICE?<P>

If you are only detained for a day or two, you could be dealing with emergency issues and probably won't need to worry about these tasks.  But as time goes on, your "trusted helper" may need money or access to your accounts in order to keep your household going while you are detained.<P>

<HR>
Next, <B>choose one or more "trusted helpers"</B> that you can trust with your assets and accounts.  <U>Share the following information with them</U> <I>as soon as you can</I>, so that they will already have all the information if you are detained for more than a day or two.<P>

The information you should share with the trusted helper are:<P>

<UL>
<LI> How can they pick up paychecks for you?  <P>
<LI> <I>bank account</I> information:  .  [TOOD:  (Austin form mentions specific banks that accept id issued by other countries...)]<P>
<LI> <I>Vehicle</I> information:  You want to transfer ownership of your vehicle.<P>
<LI> You need someone to either <I>keep paying</I> or <I>decide to close/cancel</I> your monthly bills:  car lease payment, rent payment, utility payment.<P>
<LI> You need someone to access personal belongings.  Storage spaces.<P>
<LI> Other Instructions.<P>
</UL>

<div class="boxed">
	You can use a <I>legal process</I> called <span class="term">power of attorney</span> in case you are detained.  This gives your "trusted helper" <U>more power</U> to access your accounts and assets.  
	<!-- <B>Most importantly, guardianship allows your "trusted helper" to work directly with <I>schools</I> and <I>doctors</I> to make decisions for your dependent.</B>  <I>If you are detained for more than a day or two, these powers may become necessary for your "trusted helper" to do the best job caring for your dependents.</I><P> -->

	Here's how it works:
<UL>
	<LI><B>You must set up power of attorney in advance!</B>  This isn't something that your "trusted helper" can do on their own after you are detained.  (This rule protects your legal rights as the owner of the accounts and assets.)<P>

	<LI>Usually, <B>you sign a form in front of a notary</B> to assign the power of attorney.  Talk to [TODO] to do this.  A notary needs to witness you signing the form.  In Virginia, it is illegal to charge more than $10 for this service, so do not pay more!  <P>

	<LI>On the form, you specify exactly which powers the "trusted helper" should have.  <B>It is very important to only give power of attorney to someone you trust completely, to act as you would wish.</B><P>
