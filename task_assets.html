<div class="boxed">
If you were detained by ICE for a <I>longer time</I>, who would be able to <B>access your money, your car, or your personal property</B>?
</div>

[TODO, share narratives; include an intro video; make this more engaging... expand content.]<P>

The kind of things you might <B>ask for someone to help with</B> are:

<UL>
<LI> You need someone to pick up paychecks and access your bank accounts.  [TOOD:  (Austin form mentions specific banks that accept id issued by other countries...)]<P>
<LI> You want to transfer ownership of your vehicle.<P>
<LI> You need someone to either <I>keep paying</I> or <I>decide to close/cancel</I> your monthly bills:  car lease payment, rent payment, utility payment.<P>
<LI> You need someone to access personal belongings.  Storage spaces.<P>
<LI> Other Instructions.<P>
</UL>

<div class="boxed">
You can use a <I>legal document</I> called <span class="term">power of attorney</span> in case you are detained.  This gives your "trusted helpers" <U>more power</U> to access your assets and accounts.  Generally, you sign a form in front of a notary to give the "power of attorney" and say exactly which powers the "trusted helper" should have.  <B>It is very important to only give power of attorney to someone you trust completely, to act as you would wish.</B>  Talk to [TODO] to discuss how to do this, and don't ever pay more than $10 for the notary service!<P>
