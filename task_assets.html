[TODO...]<P>

<font size="+3">
The kind of things you might <B>ask for someone to help with</B> are:

<UL>
<LI> You need someone to pick up paychecks and access your bank accounts.  (Austin form mentions banks that accept id issued by other countries...)
<LI> You want to transfer ownership of your vehicle.
<LI> You need someone to either <I>keep paying</I> or <I>decide to close/cancel</I> your monthly bills:  car lease payment, rent payment, utility payment.
<LI> You need someone to access personal belongings.  Storage spaces.
<LI> Other Instructions.
</UL>
</font>
<font size="+2">
	You can use a <I>legal document</I> called "power of attorney" in case you are detained for a <B>longer time</B>.  This gives your "trusted helpers" <U>more power</U> to access your assets.  Generally, you sign a form in front of a notary to give the "power of attorney" and say exactly which powers the "trusted helper" should have.  <B>It is very important to only give power of attorney to someone you trust completely, to act as you would wish.</B>  Talk to [TODO] to discuss how to do this, and don't ever pay more than $10 for the notary service!<P>
