<H1><B>Who can help you immediately?</B></H1><P>

[[ TODO:  I am least qualified to write this section.  Nicole or Angel:  consider helping draft this? ]]<P>

<font size="+2">

The kind of things you might <B>ask for someone to help with</B> are:
<UL>
<LI> You need someone to get information about your detainment.
	<UL>
		<LI>  [TODO]  (Write down the address of our local ICE and police centers so people can find them.)
	</UL><P>
<LI> You need an attorney to "track" you while you are detained and to submit paperwork for you.  Think about <U>sharing the following information with your attorney</U>:
	<UL>
	<LI>Your A- Alien # (if any)
	<LI>How, when and where you entered the US, and if you have a visa, and what your visa type is (if applicable).
	<LI>Whether you have been in an immigration court, and if you have been previously arrested at the US border]
	<LI>If a “Petition for Alien Relative” was submitted to them before 30 April 2001
	<LI>If a “Labor Certification” was submitted before 30 April 2001
	</UL><P>
	<LI> You will need to <U>share your attorney information with a "trusted helper"</U> so that they can tell the attorney if you are detained by ICE.<P>
		<LI> You need someone to post bond for you.  [TODO:  In Austin this apparently needs to be a US permanent resident / citizen; is that true in Virgina?]<P>

<LI> You need to <I>stay in communication</I> with all these people as things change. 
	<UL>
		<LI>[TODO  I am thinking about making sure cellphone plans are paid, register for email, copy down paper addresses?  Is there any hope for comms from within detention?  Angel's story about 10 minutes of calls per day..]
	</UL>
</UL>
