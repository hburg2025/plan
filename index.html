<H1><B>Dear Friend... let's make a plan.</B></H1><P>

<font size="+2">
We are community members, concerned about the way our town and country are changing.  We are social workers, lawyers, professors, business owners, faith leaders, and many other people who want to help.<P>

<B>This is a letter to every "undocumented" member of our community.</B><P>

<U>We value you</U>-- you are part of our community.  As we both know, actions by <I>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</I> (ICE) and related groups are increasing to take "undocumented" people into custody and <B>disrupt immigrant families</B>.  To minimize family disruption, in the event of an ICE raid, <U>you will need to plan ahead</U>.  No plan will be perfect, but having some hard conversations now could make a big difference later on.<P>

In this site, you'll hear stories from other undocumented immigrant individuals and families who have survived ICE raids and want to pass on <U>what worked</U> and <U>what didn't</U>.
We'll try to provide <U>checklists</U> that you can use to help think through what needs to be decided.  And we'll update these as we learn more, so check back!  (If you have content or information to add, email [TODO].) <P>

We stand as allies, by your side, but we don't directly face the same situations that we do.  <B>Only you and your community can decide the best ways to protect yourself and your family!</B> <P>


<P><HR>
<H2><B>First things first!</B></H2><P>

Before anything else, please:

<OL>
	<LI> <B>Be smart about personal information!</B>  You will notice <U>we don't ask for any information</U> on this site.  You <I>should</I> be suspecious of anyone asking for detailed personal information, even if they seem like they want to help or belong to a community organization.  <P>
 <UL>
	 <LI> Statements about "notorio" fraud [TODO].<P>
	 <LI> Don't leave sensitive information in a place where ICE could find it during a raid.  [TODO, backpack story of A.]
 </UL><P>

 <LI> <B>Reach out for more help, as needed.</B>  If you own real estate or business property, or have any criminal background, <I>you should definitely talk to attorney</I> for legal help.  If you have children or adults who depend on you, <I>you may want to talk to an attorney</I> about legal options in case you are detained or deported.  [TODO:  other "scope" cases?]<P> 

Some local community groups who work with undocumented immigrants include: <P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="https://www.justice4all.org/">Legal Aid Justice Center</A>,  Phone: (434) 977-0553 | International: 1-800-269-4717 (In Mexico, dial 001 first)
<LI> <A HREF="https://www.cospu.org/">COSPU</A>
<LI> <A HREF="https://newbridgesirc.org/">New Bridges</A>
<LI> [TODO]  CWS, Skyline?  others?
<LI> [TODO]  emerging pro bono lawyer groups.
</UL><P>

<LI>  <B>Don't panic!  Take action, but don't rush.</B>  You probably won't finish all of the planning or conversations in one sitting.  Do what you can with your family and your community to <I>plan a little bit each day or two</I> over a few weeks, rather than getting overwhelmed or giving up.
</OL>
