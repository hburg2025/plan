<H2><B>Dear Friend... let's make a plan.</B></H2><P>

We are community members, concerned about the way our town and country are changing.  We are teachers, social workers, lawyers, professors, business owners, faith leaders, and many other people in Harrisonburg who want to help.<P>

<B>This is a letter to every "undocumented" member of our community.</B><P>

<U>We value you</U>-- you are part of our community.  As we both know, actions by <I>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</I> (ICE) and related groups are increasing to take "undocumented" people into custody and <B>disrupt immigrant lives and families</B>.  

<div class="boxed">
	To minimize disruption, in the event of an ICE raid, <U>you will need to plan ahead</U>.  No plan will be perfect, but having some hard conversations now could make a big difference later on.
</div><P>

In this site, you'll hear stories passed on from other undocumented individuals and families who have survived ICE raids and want to pass on <U>what worked</U> and <U>what didn't</U>.
We'll try to provide <U>checklists</U> that you can use to help think through what needs to be decided.  And we'll update these as we learn more, so check back!  (If you have content or information to add, email [TODO].) <P>

We stand as allies, by your side, but we don't directly face the same situations that we do.  <B>Only you and your community can decide the best ways to protect yourself and your family!</B> <P>

[TODO:  some kind of intro video?]
